# TinyApp Project

### *TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly)!*

Tired of stifling your witty commentary to leave enough room for a meme link?  
Feeling limited by character limitations in input text fields?  
Wish there was a better way?  

**There's TinyApp.** ðŸŽ‰

Say goodbye to incredibly long and boring website address links.  
Say *hello* to shareable shortlinks that leave plenty of room for your **_sass_**! ðŸ¤©  

## Final Product

*Logged-in user view of saved short URLs:*
